Folk horror, the conflict between the Old Ways and the Church

### Characters
Characters should be from the High Clans, preferentially Clans Brujah, Lasombra or Toreador, but high generation (10th or younger) vampires of Clans Cappadocian and Ventrue are easily accommodated. Of the Low Clans, Gangrel, Nosferatu, and Tremere are recommended, with Clans Assamite, Malkavian, and Ravnos not recommended for new players. Followers of Set and members of Clan Tzimisze need a _very_ good reason to be present.
## Safety and Consent
Details (including specific safety tools) will be part of Session 0, including Lines and Veils. If you want to prepare something, check the links below.
### X, N, O Cards (subject to change!)
This is a check-in tool during the live session, and allows players to stop and/or pause any given scene/description.
#### X in chat/voice
The scene ends, and we take a break. The session continues after the X'd scene.
#### N in chat/voice
The scene pauses, and we can take a break. The session can continue with an [[#O Card]] after the break, or ends/fades to black without an O Card.
#### O Card
The scene continues after everyone checked in with an O.

### Lines and Veils
This is where we "draw a line" or "draw a veil": Lines are non-negotiable no-go zones, Veils can come up, but the scene will fade to black during live sessions.

As an example, i've added my personal Lines and Veils (if you insist on a Line, you need to find another GM)
#### cassie's Lines
- harm to children
- sexual violence
- queerphobia
#### cassie's Veils
- sex
- torture
