## Players
- 4 Players, with characters starting at Level 1
- No previous experience in table-top roleplay or Pathfinder necessary
- Need a browser that works with [Owlbear Rodeo](https://www.owlbear.rodeo/) (expect a transition to Foundry VTT)
## Time Commitment
Up to 4  hours, and at least once a month, but every other week if possible, Mondays to Saturdays, start time [1600h UTC](https://dateful.com/convert/utc?t=16)(12pm EDT/17:00 BST/18:00 CEST) to [1800h UTC](https://dateful.com/convert/utc?t=18) (4pm EDT/19:00 BST/20:00 CEST)
## Campaign Setting
The campaign begins in and around Taldoran's Avin prefecture, bounded by Fogs Peak, the World's Edge Mountains, and the Verduran province/forest. The players are new arrivals in or first-time adventurers from the area, ready to take on their first adventure.
## Themes
### Goals
- An introduction to Pathfinder for new players and GMs
- A dose of escapism together with the people in our devices
### Genre
Heroic high fantasy with sprinklings of science fantasy for flavor
Adventurer expectations: By way of heroic deeds of heroism the players make a positive, ideally lasting, impact on the daily lives of the people(s) around them.
### Style
Sandbox-ish: player-driven exploration and dungeon delving within a framework of opportunities curated by the GM. The goal is to strike a balance between player fun, group goals, and an overarching story.
### Tone
Best described as "action thriller". Not necessarily family friendly, but also not grim. Heroes make a difference, and bring hope to the people(s) around them. However, heroism requires risk and involves sacrifice, and players should be aware that even heroes can die when they make poor or foolish decisions. the GM will always provide counsel on courses of action.
### Rating Content
Fantasy violence (but not gratuitous violence for the sake of grossing out players) will happen, as well as the gothic horror of dealing with the undead. 

This is a positive list: if it isn't mention explicitly, then NPCs will **at most** allude to a topic. See [[#Safety and Consent]].
## The Game Rules
See also: [Player's Guide - Archives of Nethys: Pathfinder 2nd Edition Database](https://2e.aonprd.com/PlayersGuide.aspx)

The following list of rulebooks is not set in stone, but will likely evolve as the campaign progresses and our shared familiarity with Pathfinder or Golarion increases (or we get sick and tired of playing, whichever comes first).
### Character Generation
### General
Heritages of available Ancestries hailing from [Taldor](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Taldor) and the surrounding nations of the [Shining Kingdoms](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Shining_Kingdoms) region, and within reasonable distance from Taldor, or [with a coast along the Inner Sea](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Inner_Sea#Nations_on_the_Inner_Sea) are strongly recommended for all players.
#### Ancestries
Player Core: all
Player Core 2: Catfolk, Ratfolk, Lizardfolk, Tripkee
#### Classes
Player Core: all
Player Core 2: Not recommended for players new to Pathfinder and/or Golarion
#### Backgrounds
Player Core: all
Player Core 2: all, but Uncommon and Rare Backgrounds are not recommended for players new to Pathfinder and/or Golarion
### Recommended Background Reading
https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Portal:History
Taldor: The First Empire, Pathfinder 1E (to be replaced with Lost Omens: Shining Kingdoms ASAP)

## Safety and Consent
Details (including specific safety tools) will be part of Session 0, including Lines and Veils. If you want to prepare something, check the links below.
### X, N, O Cards (subject to change!)
This is a check-in tool during the live session, and allows players to stop and/or pause any given scene/description.
#### X in chat/voice
The scene ends, and we take a break. The session continues after the X'd scene.
#### N in chat/voice
The scene pauses, and we can take a break. The session can continue with an [[#O Card]] after the break, or ends/fades to black without an O Card.
#### O Card
The scene continues after everyone checked in with an O.

### Lines and Veils
This is where we "draw a line" or "draw a veil": Lines are non-negotiable no-go zones, Veils can come up, but the scene will fade to black during live sessions.

As an example, i've added my personal Lines and Veils (if you insist on a Line, you need to find another GM)
#### cassie's Lines
- child abuse
- sexual violence
- torture
- transphobia
#### cassie's Veils
- sex
- depictions of spousal abuse
